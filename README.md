Rails Market Sprint App Skeleton
================================

This is a Rails app that includes everything we want before we start rapid prototyping during a Market Sprint.

Creating a new application from this template
---------------------------------------------

First, make sure you have the rails executable and that it is at the same version as that used by this template (4.1.0):

    $ gem install rails -v 4.1.0

    $ rails new my_app_name -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adaptivelab/market_sprint_rails_template/master/template.rb

Applying or re-applying this template to an existing app
-----------------------------------------

    $ bundle exec rake rails:template LOCATION=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adaptivelab/market_sprint_rails_template/master/template.rb

What's in the box?

| Pages model & controller | Allows us to whack in static images as pages, willy nilly.  See [down there](#pages) for more information |

Admin
-----

Admin lives at the relative URL, '/admin'.  At first, the admin user is 'admin@example.com' and the password is 'password'.  You should probably alter that if you make anything public.

Pages
-----

To add in a page that's just a static image (or even a chain of pages), you can use the Pages tab in the (admin)[#admin] section.

The page slug determines the URL it will live at.  The relative URL will be "/pages/my-slug", where 'my-slug' is your slug.  Obvs.  Using that knowledge, you can chain pages of static images together, by entering another /pages/{slug} URL in as the next_url.  Simples!

Compass
-------
You can now add and edit sass stylesheets in the app/assets/sass subdirectory of your project.

Sass files beginning with an underscore are called partials and won't be
compiled to CSS, but they can be imported into other sass stylesheets.

You can configure your project by editing the config.rb configuration file.

You must compile your sass stylesheets into CSS when they change.

This can be done in one of the following ways:
1. To compile on demand:
  * compass compile [path/to/project]
2. To monitor your project for changes and automatically recompile:
  * compass watch [path/to/project]

Production checklist
--------------------

Make sure you set the following environment variables:

**SECRET_KEY_BASE**

What if I want to add to this template?
---------------------------------------

Pull request!  Make changes to this app, ensure they work.  Then update the template.rb file if you need to.  To speed up trying out chages, you can use the local path to the template.rb instead of the URL when applying the template.
