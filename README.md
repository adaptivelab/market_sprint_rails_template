Rails Market Sprint App Skeleton
================================

This is a Rails app that includes everything we want before we start rapid prototyping during a Market Sprint.  This repo is the base - the application templates are then created from a fork, replacing the occurrences of application name and any other relevant variables with replacement template code.
